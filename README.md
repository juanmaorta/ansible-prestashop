# ansible-prestashop
Basic Vagrant/Ansible LAMP server for Prestashop

This is a basic configuration of a LAMP stack for Prestashop 1.5

Simply run --vagrant up-- and magic will start to happen: apache2, php, mysql (with passwords), and Prestashop download.

Then, go to the private IP in Vagrant file and continue the Prestashop installation.

User/pass for the database is prestashop/prestashop... easy, uh?
